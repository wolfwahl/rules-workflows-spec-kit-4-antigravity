# Global quality gates for baseline and CI verification.
# These gates are enforced in both:
# - scripts/run_local_ci.sh
# - .github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml

# Branch coverage gate (scoped/testable code only).
# Enforced by scripts/verify_coverage_baseline.sh against scoped LCOV BRDA data.
# If BRDA data is unavailable, the script falls back to scoped line coverage.
# Scope is global lib/** (minus technical excludes in coverage_exclude_patterns).

# Mutation testing gates.
# Applied to the default (stable) mutation profile used by blocking CI gates.
# A strict profile may run as advisory/non-blocking deep analysis.

MIN_HIGH_RISK_MUTATION_SCORE_PCT=85

# Runtime budget for mutation gate execution.

# 10/10 suite mode (optional, deeper local quality run).
