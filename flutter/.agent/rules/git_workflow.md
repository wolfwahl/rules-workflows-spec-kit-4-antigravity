# Git Workflow Rules

You are working in a Git-controlled project. Follow these rules regarding version control:

## Commits
1. **DO NOT Auto-Commit**: Never run `git commit` immediately after modifying files unless explicitly asked by the user.
2. **User Review First**: Always allow the user to review file changes (edits) first.
3. **Explicit Confirmation**: Only run `git commit` when the user signals that the changes are accepted or asks you to `save` or `checkpoint` the work.
