# Contributing

This is a personal experiment, so I'm not actively seeking contributions.

However, if you:

- Found a problem or inconsistency in the rules
- Have a suggestion based on your own experience with Antigravity + Flutter + Supabase
- Want to share how you adapted these rules for your project
- Spotted a typo or broken link

Feel free to open an issue. No guarantees on response time or implementation – remember, this is an ongoing experiment, and I'm wrong every day.

## What I'm NOT looking for

- Pull requests that fundamentally change the architecture philosophy
- Requests to support other backends besides Supabase
- Requests to make this a "stable framework"

## What I AM interested in

- Real-world experiences using rules and workflows
- Edge cases I haven't experienced
- Better ways to express patterns to Antigravity
- Ways to survive with AI in a project over time
- How to handle uncertainty
- Corrections to factual errors
- Best practices

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. Be curious. Be honest about what works and what doesn't.
